# Project Status

Open Communication Protocol (OCP) is currently in an incubation state.

The original paper v0.2 establishes the conceptual foundation of the protocol.
No further specification, implementation, or standardization efforts
are planned at this stage.

This repository exists to preserve the origin of the idea.

Future updates, if any, will be deliberate and infrequent.
