## Introduction

For a long time, communication was understood as an exchange of words between humans.

That assumption is quietly collapsing.

Today, humans interact daily with AI agents, automated systems, institutions,
and environments embedded with sensors and software.
These entities are no longer mere tools.
They receive actions, make decisions, and return outcomes.

Despite this, we still hesitate to call these interactions "conversation".
Instead, they are treated as operations.

This discomfort is the starting point of Open Communication Protocol.

---

## Operating Instead of Conversing

Modern digital communication appears sophisticated:
email, chat systems, APIs, and agent frameworks.

Yet meaning remains implicit.

Humans repeatedly infer:
- whether something is a request or mere information
- whether something is actually completed
- who has authority to move things forward

Meaning is not shared.
It is guessed.

---

## The Success and Limits of Existing Communication

Email and chat systems succeeded because they allowed ambiguity.
Society continued to function even when meaning was unclear.

However, this looseness caused requests, agreements,
completion, and casual remarks to flow through the same channel.

As a result, what actually happened is rarely finalized.

---

## Execution Was Standardized; Meaning Was Not

Protocols for execution and integration have advanced rapidly.
AI agents can operate tools and access data across systems.

Yet fundamental questions remain unanswered:
- Is this a request?
- Is this an agreement?
- Is this completion?
- Who is authorized to finalize it?

Execution is possible.
Meaning remains undefined.

---

## A Layer Intentionally Left Undefined

Concepts such as request, agreement, completion,
authority, and responsibility were not omitted by accident.

They were avoided because defining them inevitably touches
accountability, power, and institutional responsibility.

As AI becomes an acting participant,
this semantic void can no longer be ignored.

---

## The Proposal: Open Communication Protocol

Open Communication Protocol defines no content,
no execution logic, and no user interface.

It addresses a single question:

**What does this interaction count as having happened?**

OCP is a semantic infrastructure
for humans, AI, systems, and institutions
to converse under a shared understanding.

---

## Core Concepts

### Pledge

A pledge is an act of semantic self-commitment by the sender.
It is neither a statement of fact nor an emotional expression.

It binds the sender to a declared meaning.

### State

A state is a snapshot finalized only when
defined conditions across multiple pledges are satisfied.

Declarations alone do not advance states.

### Sovereignty

Sovereignty defines who is authorized
to provide the final input that fixes a state.

It is neither correctness nor power,
but a minimal trigger for state transition.

---

## Normal and Pre-Normal States

OCP does not eliminate ambiguity.

Casual remarks, impressions, and unclear utterances
are absorbed as pre-normal states.

They carry meaning,
but they do not move the system forward.

---

## The World OCP Envisions

A world where humans no longer operate systems,
but converse with them.

A world where actions are explainable after the fact.

OCP aims to exist like electricity or the internet:
present, but unnoticed.

---

## Why Now

Within a few years,
this layer will be defined by governments,
large corporations, or standardization bodies.

This document places the first stone.

It does not seek completeness,
only origin.

---

## Closing

Open Communication Protocol is a semantic infrastructure
for a world in which humans converse
not only with other humans,
but with everything that acts in the digital realm.
