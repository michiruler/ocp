# Open Communication Protocol (OCP)

A semantic infrastructure for conversation between humans, AI, and systems.

This repository preserves the original conceptual paper for **Open Communication Protocol (OCP)**.
OCP proposes a missing semantic layer in digital communication:
a shared way to determine **what an interaction counts as having happened**.

## What OCP Is

Open Communication Protocol does not define:
- message formats
- APIs
- execution logic
- user interfaces
- security or defense mechanisms

Instead, OCP focuses on semantic commitment and state finalization
through three core concepts:

- **Pledge**: semantic self-commitment by the sender
- **State**: a snapshot finalized only when defined conditions are satisfied
- **Sovereignty**: who is authorized to finalize a state transition

OCP is designed to remain an invisible infrastructure layer.

## What OCP Is Not

- Not a chat system
- Not a workflow engine
- Not an agent protocol
- Not a security framework
- Not a product specification

## Documents

- **Canonical document**
  - [`original-paper/ocp_v0.2_en.md`](./original-paper/ocp_v0.2_en.md)
